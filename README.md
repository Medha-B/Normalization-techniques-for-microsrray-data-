# Normalization-techniques-for-microarray-data
Normalization plays an important role in the earlier stage of microarray data analysis. The subsequent analysis results are highly dependent on normalization.
Techniques used here include:
1. Normalization
2. Standardization
3. Min-max scaler
4. Max-absolute scaler
5. Robust scaler
6. Quantile Transformer
7. Power Transformer
The breast canacer dataset used is typical of other microarray datasets.
